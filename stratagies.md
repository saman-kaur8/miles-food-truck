This venture will come under **differentiation strategy**, whereas this will attract not only Indian people but also local people in the city. Meals provided by this venture will be different than other food in the city. Providing delicious meals and making good relationship with the customers. There will be a market value of this venture because being the first food truck with an application, it will hold a place which no one has yet.

The only strategy which will be circulated to the employees will be to do their job at their best and try to give the initiative in providing delicious meal to our customers. Fast service, polite staff, delicious happy meals will be the major concerns under my strategies that will be circulated to my employees.
