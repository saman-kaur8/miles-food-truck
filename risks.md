From food quality to paying taxes everything carries a huge risk with itself in field of food.

1\. Finance Management

2\. Expensive ingredients

3\. Health Management

4\. Competitive Venture

5\. Mechanical Issues

6. Technical issues

**Finance Management**

Financial management is the risk taken by the owner to start this business plan. For example, taking loan from the bank while not knowing that the venture will be successful or not, also not knowing that the venture will give the positive output only. Because now a days, there is a lot of competition between in the food market, many people are thinking that it is the easy way to earn money and respect in the market but on same hand it is also risky as one never knows whether their food is liked by the customers or not. Not just the best cooking skills and good food is enough for such business but also the serving and maintenance of healthy food and other things make a food business successful.

Other than the basics requirements of business keeping the financial records clean and up to date is a big task. Whether you are earing enough or not you have to pay the bills, your installments and the paying salary to the staff. These are some major things that the owner cannot ignore even once. The risk is that he may earn enough, or he may not. It is unpredictable. If he earns enough so that he can manage his financial records than the risk taken might seem good to the entrepreneur but if he is not earning enough than risks of finance might increase as well.

**Buying/Stocking food**

The second risk involves the management of the raw material. One must take care of what kind of raw material the venture needs and in what quantity and how long it will survive. If one has no knowledge of food and still goes to buy the material for such venture it is a risk because there are so many kinds of food materials available in the market. Some are excellent some are worse. Its hard to choose the correct thing without proper knowledge.

This kind risk can be reduced only by having the proper knowledge of what to buy in what quantity and must be fresh.

**Health Management**

Managing that the food made by this venture is healthy for the customers is the biggest concern. Obviously if any of the customers gets any kind of health issues after eating your food and complaints about it then the venture is screwed. Venture might have chance to get legal notice in such conditions and everything can get ruined in a term of short period. Managing the cleanliness and the hygiene of the venture is a major concern.

To avoid this risk,this is the duty of chef to prepare healthy food along keeping hygiene in mind.

**Competitive Venture**

As mentioned earlier that this venture is competitive because some people thinks that serving food to people is the easiest way to make money. But no one first thinks about the major risks involved with the thought of serving people food. One must be very careful while preparing a meal for someone. It may happen the food made by you is liked by some persons but disliked by other persons. Everyone has different tastes. Some like sweat some like spicy. It varies from person to person. This is all the part of this venture.

Many restaurants in the city right now which are serving healthy and delicious food and are old too. People love going their they might not want to try anything new or even if they do try, they may like their old taste.

So, to reduce this risk the only way is to make healthy and more delicious food which attracts customer automatically and provide them a reliable food service.

**Mechanical Issues**

As it is a Food Truck which is basically a truck carrying food, cooking machines, oil, gas, equipment and staff into it that doesn’t make truck a restaurant. After all it is moving truck for which a skilled professional driver is much needed who will operate the truck. There might be some mechanical issues anyhow with the truck and at any time. These kinds of risks are unpredictable.

Maintenance of the truck should be done timely in order to reduce any mechanical failure.

**Technical issues**

Now talking of the online application which is connected to this venture. Investing in an application for this venture is kind of risk which one will be taking with this venture. There are already many online food ordering services in the society. Why would the people choose the venture application for ordering the food?!

By making the application effective and attractive to the customers or not linking the application to other food service application. Then the customers will have to download the venture application to order food. The technical issues with the application might happen which can be resolved later at that time.
