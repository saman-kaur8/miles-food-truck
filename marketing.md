 **The customer and the target segment.**

This venture will attract those people who are willing to add healthy and delicious food to their daily routine. As in the fastmoving world everyone has their own eating habits which are mostly like that the people don’t get time to make food for their own self. So this venture will attract the customers who are busy in their daily lives and had no time to make food for themselves on the behalf of which this food truck will be providing healthy and delicious food to them. Serving food quick will be one of the main targets of this venture.

**Reaching to customers.**

There are several ways to reach the customers, beginning with the basic, this may sound like an old manual idea but according to my opinion, this will be the first step for reaching to the customers, that is through **pamphlets** which will be including all the menu details and everything about the food truck services.

Distributing pamphlets in the city may be an old idea but I found it very attractive because we do ignore advertisements if we watch them online. Pamphlets are never ignored by people specially when they are about food. At least people will go through the paper once. Reaching to the customers in other ways like making online advertisements such as Instagram and Facebook. Now a days you can make your own page for free on Instagram and Facebook. Such ways are effective and interesting way to do the work in today’s world.
