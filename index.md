    **BUISNESS PLAN**

    Food truck company startup is designed to provide healthy food and drinks. Food truck will be competing with the classical brick and mortar fast food restaurants, currently considered by an increasing number of consumers which is an unhealthy habit. The food truck startup will be setup in the city, near the college, or wherever demanding, after all it will be truck that provides healthy food and could be able to go anywhere.

    **TARGET**

    The key thing about this business idea will be that an android and an ios application will be build for the customers so that they can see the menu updates on their phone and options like placing online order or cancelling order will be accepted through that app. It will save the customer time and they could pick order on their way to work. All one have to do is paying the bill and pick their order, no long waiting queues. Serving quick, healthy and delicious service will be the first target of the business.

    **COMPETENCIES AND SKILLS**

    The biggest current challenge in this field is the legal background, varying between states and placing stringent constrains on the operations of the food trucks. And also to deal with the restaurants to which consumers are addicted. Will also be applying few marketing strategies like distributing pamphlets and other advertising techniques so that more and more citizens should come to know about the startup

    **Skills** needed for this startup is to have a great staff which includes:

    · Good cooks

    · Good servers

    · And team members with good Communication and Technical skills.

    **STAKEHOLDERS**

    Getting an investment for a startup is a first question when one thinks of a startup. When the idea of opening a food truck service stroked in my mind the question of the investment was generated automatically. So this startup plan, the execution of the startup will be done with a trustworthy partner investing 50 percent of his share in the business and helping the business idea to be a successful business in the future.

    **PASSION & COMMITMENT**

    I have immense love, passion and commitment for food in my life. I don’t like the way some companies are serving bad junk food to the consumers which are giving them major health issues. That even sounds bad. So the main objective of this startup will be to provide healthy and delicious food to the consumers and make them happy. Our main motive will be to serve healthy and delicious food.

    **IS IT GOOD FOR YOU?**

    Yes, pretty much this is the best I could do in my life. It is like my dream job to serve people good food. Even being an IT student I couldn’t forget my love for cooking. As a result of that I thought of this small startup plan linked with my IT profile because I don’t want my love for coding to fade away. So I will be designing the website and applications for my own startup and hoping for the best for this idea.
